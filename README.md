This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In this project you are able to see a Pokédex prototype, populated with the first 151 Pokémons.
There is a search field that filters the Pokédex as each character is typed in it.
There is a Pokémon Type select box that filters the Pokédex to show only Pokémons that are that type.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
